Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies. This project focuses on building a machine learning-based churn prediction system to identify customers likely to leave the service, enabling proactive retention strategies.
The solution covers the complete data science lifecycle, from data exploration to model deployment.
Predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on usage patterns, service details, and customer demographics.
